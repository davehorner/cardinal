## Chocolatal: TAL Preprocessor for uxn-tal

- **`chocolatal.rs`** is a Rust module providing preprocessing for Uxn TAL assembly files, it attempts to be a faithful implementation of the original [deluge-domain](https://codeberg.org/davehorner/deluge-domain) `preprocess-tal.sh` shell script by [@notchoc](https://codeberg.org/notchoc). It is designed to be used as a standalone module within the `uxn-tal` assembler, located in the `mod/` directory.

`uxntal` binary uses chocolatal by default.
