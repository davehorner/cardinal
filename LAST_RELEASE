- *(input)* hot pluggable xbox controller support and letters/numbers now work.  shared variables are also working between the grids.  the cardinal-demo supports the buttons on the xbox but the dpad doesn't work.  analog pads and repeat are not yet working.  this is functional enough that someone could actually use it.
